# edit-filenames

Renames or moves files (or directories) using a text editor.

Allows paths to a large number of files to be edited using features of a text
editor, such as search-and-replace or multi-cursor editing.

The text editor to use will be determined from the `VISUAL` or `EDITOR`
environment variables.  The editor alternatively can be explicitly specified via
the `-e`/`--editor` command-line option.  The editor can be set to `sed` or to
other similar tools to non-interactively edit filenames.

Note that tabbed editors typically will need to be passed additional
command-line options to spawn independent instances.  This is necessary for
`edit-filenames` to determine when the edited file is closed.  See the examples
below.


## Installation

`edit-filenames` depends on submodules, so `--recurse-submodules` is necessary
when using `git clone`:
```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jamesderlin/edit-filenames.git
```


## Examples

* To use Visual Studio Code (`code`) to rename all files in the current
  directory:

    ```shell
    edit-filenames -e "code --wait" ./*
    ```

* To use `sed` to replace "apples" with "bananas" for all filenames in the
  current directory:

    ```shell
    edit-filenames -e "sed -i s/apples/bananas/" ./*
    ```

* To add a `.png` extension to all files in the current directory that are
  identified as PNG images (and that don't already have a `.png` extension):

    ```shell
    file --mime-type ./* | grep image/png | grep --invert-match .png \
    | cut -d : -f 1 \
    | xargs edit-filenames -e "sed -i s/$/.png/"
    ```
